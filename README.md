# Mastring SAP CAP + Fiori Elements V4 Development
This repo is a learning guide that help developers gain the full power of combinning SAP CAP and SAP Fiori Elements V4. 

It will especially on helping you understand annotations. You should able to fully understand the annotations and logic of them instead of relying on copy / paste from document or other code.

I will not repeat what already mentioned in other document. I am trying to write down the key part that filling the gap or glue other documents together. 

## Who could get help from this repo
You shoud 
1. You should have already developed some simple app using SAP CAP and Fiori Elements for OData V4 and understand the basic concepts.
2. You are able to use SAP Fiori tools to build features
3. You know how to write some basis annotations on CDS

BUT
1. You rely too much on copy/past from document or other code samples.
2. You can not write annotations / configrations from scratch
3. You don't understand the logic behind the framework
4. Every time you use Fiori Elements you feel it is not under control and have issues here and there

## How this repo can help you 
1. Explain annotation concept in simple word
2. We start with building simple annotations from scratch
3. Re-orgnize content from official documents to make it easier to understand.

## Progress
Just started, nothing here yet.
